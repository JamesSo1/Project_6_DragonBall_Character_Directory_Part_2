# Web Development Project 6 - Dragonball Character Directory 

Submitted by: **James So**

This web app: **allows users to look up characters from the anime Dragonball based on a character's name, power level, and race (i.e. human, saiyan, android, etc.). Users can select a specific character from the database to see the character's basic information alongside a graph comparing the charcter's power level to that of the smallest, average, and largest power level of the entire data set.**

## Notes

The main challenge with building this app was figuring out how to create a unique route for each character entry in the database using dynamic routing. Another challenge was learning to use ReCharts since I have never used it before.
